# IterativeHeaps.jl

Julia package for iterative heaps w/cache arrays, including parallel heaps using DistributedArrays().

Includes four different types of heaps:

- FibonacciHeap:
- KaryHeap: 
- RandomQueue:
- SimpleQueue: 



## Use


## Data

The code only needs a Graph to work off of. This can be loaded in a Julia session using `Graphs.jl`. If using `DiscreteGraphAlgorithms.jl`, then the `graph` property of a `GraphWrapper` can be used.


## Project information

Name the project sponsor, funding mechanism, period of performance, and any context of the research that would help outside readers understand your work.
